        <h1>Our Coffee History</h1>
        <p>
          Walk through the glass doors of our roastery at Coffee.Inc and you
          will be greeted by two coffee roasting machines: a large volume 80kg
          Menado roaster and a smaller UG22 Probat roaster. Between the two, we
          roast over four and a half tonnes of coffee every week for our blends
          as well as premium single origins. At Coffee.Inc, our blends are the
          cornerstone of the coffee we offer to our customers.
        </p>

        <br />
        <br />

        <p>
          By combining coffee that originates from various coffee-producing
          regions of the world, we are able to create an experience that is
          greater than the sum of its parts. A balanced cup that is full of
          flavour and tingles the palate.
        </p>
